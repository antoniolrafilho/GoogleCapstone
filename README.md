# Case study: How does a bike-share navigate speedy success?

## Introduction

Welcome to the Cyclistic bike-share analysis case study! As a Junior Data Analyst at Cyclistic, I'll be diving into our data to maximize annual memberships and drive future growth. Let's uncover insights together!

## Objective

My team and I believe that understanding the differences between casual riders and annual members is crucial. By analyzing data and creating compelling visualizations, we aim to design a new marketing strategy to convert casual riders into annual members. Our recommendations will be presented to Cyclistic executives for approval.

## Team Collaboration

I work alongside Lily Moreno, our director of marketing, and the Cyclistic marketing analytics team. Together, we'll analyze data to guide our marketing strategy decisions and support Cyclistic's mission and business goals.

## About Cyclistic

Cyclistic has grown its bike-share program since its successful launch in 2016. With over 5,800 bicycles and 600 docking stations across Chicago, we offer inclusive options for all riders. While casual riders purchase single-ride or full-day passes, annual memberships drive profitability for Cyclistic.

## Approach

Now, with a clear goal in mind, my team and I will analyze historical bike trip data to understand customer behavior and identify trends. Let's work towards converting casual riders into annual members and driving Cyclistic's future growth together!
